# Codility Manganum 2017 Challenge

This is my code for Codility's Manganum 2017 Challenge, which is a difficult programming challenge that tests both correctness and efficiency. In this repository I have my two attempts. The first one ended up not being a correct approach, but I solved it on my second try.

Try it out yourself at https://codility.com/programmers/task/final_turn/

Copy pasting someone elses solution doesn't count, so try to solve it using your own problem solving skills!
